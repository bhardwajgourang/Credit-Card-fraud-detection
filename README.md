📌 Overview

This project implements an anomaly detection–based credit card fraud detection model using the popular Kaggle creditcard.csv dataset.
The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, where only 0.17% are fraudulent — making this a highly imbalanced classification problem.

To handle this, the project uses unsupervised anomaly detection models:

Isolation Forest

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

Both models identify unusual patterns that differ significantly from normal transactions.

🚀 Features

Load and preprocess large credit card transaction data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Histograms for each feature

Correlation heatmap

Data sampling (10% for faster prototyping)

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Fraud detection using:

Isolation Forest

Local Outlier Factor

Performance evaluation with:

🧠 Models Used

Isolation Forest

 1)  Detects anomalies by “isolating” observations
 
 2)  Works well on high-dimensional data
 
 3)  Fast and scalable

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
  
  1) Flags points that differ significantly from neighbors
 
  2) More sensitive to feature scaling → requires StandardScaler
  
  3) Measures local deviation of density
